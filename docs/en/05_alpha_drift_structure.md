## 5.1 Definition and Structure of the $\alpha$-Drift

The $\alpha$-drift is a **structural phase shift** generated by the
**asynchrony** between technological progression ($r_{\text{real}}$)
and the market’s learning process ($r_{\text{market}}$).

It is not merely “the average of observation errors.”
Rather, it is a **systematic displacement** arising from intrinsic
**information delays, decay dynamics, and sensitivity variation** within the observation process.

This section defines $\alpha$-drift as a primary output of RIMC and clarifies its mathematical and physical structure.

---

### 5.1.1 Definition and General Expression

The $\alpha$-drift is defined as the accumulated phase displacement produced by
the lagged difference between the real recursion rate and the market-imputed recursion rate:

$$
\boxed{
\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
= \int_{t-T}^{t} \varepsilon_R(\tau)\, G(\tau)\, e^{-\lambda (t-\tau)}\, d\tau
}
$$

| Symbol             | Meaning                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\varepsilon_R(t)$ | Observation gap between real and market-estimated recursion   |
| $G(t)$             | Sensitivity kernel converting recursion-gap into value-change |
| $\lambda$          | Market learning–forgetting rate                               |
| $T$                | Finite memory window                                          |

Under this decomposition:

* $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$ corresponds to the **AC component** (temporal fluctuation)
* $\alpha_{\text{drift}}$ corresponds to the **DC component** (mean displacement)

Thus, market $\alpha$ is the sum of **dynamic energy** and **baseline shift**.

The exponential memory kernel $e^{-\lambda(t-\tau)}$ causes older gaps to decay gradually,
yet finite observation ensures that a **persistent asymmetry** remains.

**AC/DC Decomposition:**

$$
\alpha(t)=\alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)+\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
$$

$$
\alpha_{\text{drift}}=\langle \alpha(t)\rangle_T,
\qquad
\alpha_{\text{cycle}}=\alpha(t)-\alpha_{\text{drift}}
$$

---

### 5.1.2 Cycle–Drift Relationship in Continuous-Time Systems

In RIMC, the $\alpha$-cycle and $\alpha$-drift follow the same relaxation equation.
The cycle dynamics satisfy:

$$
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{cycle}}}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)\,G(t) - \lambda\,\alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)
$$

Integrating this relationship yields the drift:

$$
\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
= \int_{t_0}^{t}
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{cycle}}}{d\tau}\, d\tau
$$

(here, additive constants depend on the reference point $t_0$).

Thus $\alpha$-drift emerges as the **low-frequency component** of the relaxation system.
“Low frequency” denotes a slowly varying trend relative to short-horizon oscillations.

The two are not distinct phenomena;
they are **self-similar manifestations** of the same relaxation dynamics under different time scales.

In nonlinear systems with

* finite memory,
* exponential kernels,
* phase-shifted inputs $x(t-\tau)$,
  the output’s mean generally fails to converge to zero.

## 5.2 Dynamic Structure and Interference Mechanics of $\alpha$-Drift

We now shift from the static formulation to the **dynamic evolution** of $\alpha$-drift.
The objective is to clarify how $\alpha$ is **generated, dissipated, perturbed**,
and how endogenous and exogenous forces interfere.

Two mechanisms must be separated:

1. **Endogenous Drift (structural $\alpha$-drift)**
   Produced by differences in technological acceleration vs. market learning speed.
   → “$R$ leading $V$” creates recursive structural uplift.

2. **Exogenous Drift (noise-induced $\alpha$-drift)**
   Generated by crowd psychology, media shocks, SNS-driven cascades.
   → “$V$ appearing to lead $R$” creates psychological bias.

The interaction of these two yields a system where
**structural growth waves** and **emotional modulation waves** interfere.

Next we derive the dynamic equation capturing these interactions and
express $\alpha$ fluctuations as the interplay of **endogenous force**, **exogenous disturbance**, and **informational inertia**.

---

### 5.2.1 Sign Structure and Phase Interpretation

| Condition         | $\varepsilon_R$ | Market State          | Drift Direction         | Economic Interpretation  |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Technology leads  | $>0$            | Market underestimates | Positive $\alpha$ drift | Latent upward pressure   |
| Market runs ahead | $<0$            | Market overestimates  | Negative $\alpha$ drift | Latent downward pressure |

The sign of $\alpha$-drift encodes not price direction per se,
but the **phase relationship** between technological evolution and market inference.

As long as the market learns from the past while technology generates the future,
this asynchrony is inherent, producing persistent structural displacement.

---

## 5.3 Properties of Structural Displacement

The $\alpha$-drift manifests as a **delayed, asymmetric integration phenomenon**
in the transmission of information.

Short-term price moves are merely secondary fluctuations superimposed upon this structural baseline.

Information arrival and absorption vary across agents, so
$\alpha$-drift is not a single “price reaction” but a
**nonlinear average over heterogeneous observation structures**.

---

## 5.4 Dynamic Equation and “Informational Inertia”

In first-order approximation, the drift evolves as:

$$
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{drift}}}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)\,G(t)

- \lambda\,\alpha(t)
$$

* First term: **generation pressure** from technological lead

* Second term: **correction pressure** from market learning

Because the market absorbs information with **finite propagation speed**,
$\alpha_{\text{drift}}$ does not converge to zero;
a residual persists due to **informational inertia**.

**Short-Horizon Limit Note**
If the market reacts extremely rapidly ($\lambda \to 0$ and $G(t)\approx G_0$):

$$
\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
\ \propto\
\frac{d}{dt}\varepsilon_R(t)
$$

Thus RIMC may also be interpreted as a **differential response model** of the market
to the *rate of change* in the observation gap.

This is the endogenous model; in §5.5 we add exogenous noise to obtain the full dynamic form.

---

## 5.5 Dynamic Equation with Noise-Induced $\alpha$-Drift

The full evolution combines structural and non-structural forces:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{drift}}}{dt}
=
-\underbrace{\varepsilon_R(t)\,G(t)}_{\text{Endogenous Drift}}

-\underbrace{\lambda\,\alpha(t)}_{\text{Learning Decay}}

-\underbrace{\xi(t)}_{\text{Noise-Induced Drift}}
}
\tag{5.5.1}
$$

The exogenous noise term (from §4.4) is:

$$
\xi(t)=\xi_0(t)+\chi\,\phi(t)
$$

where

* $\xi_0(t)$ = observational noise / measurement variation

* $\phi(t)$ = psychological drivers (SNS intensity, media volume, search spikes)

* $\chi$ = linear sensitivity of price response to information shocks

* Term 1: structural drift from asynchronous R–V recursion

* Term 2: learning/forgetting-driven dissipation

* Term 3: aggregated psychological disturbance

Thus the market becomes a **semi-open interference system** combining
**endogenous recursion** and **exogenous perturbation**.

Because the system is never fully closed and always subject to stochastic influence,
$\alpha_{\text{drift}}$ does not collapse to zero;
it persists as a **statistical residual**.

---

## 5.6 Mechanistic Interaction of Endogenous and Exogenous Drift

From (5.6):

$$
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{drift}}}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)\,G(t)

- \lambda\,\alpha(t)
- \xi(t)
\tag{5.6}
$$

This expresses the market as a **dual-drift dynamic system**.

---

### 5.6.1 Endogenous Drift (“Structural $\alpha$-Drift”)

Endogenous drift arises from the difference between technological acceleration and the pace of market learning.

It represents a **forward-shift of information**, or structural lead of $R$ over $V$:

* If $\varepsilon_R(t)>0$:
  Technology leads → structural upward pressure (latent upward revision)

* If $\varepsilon_R(t)<0$:
  Market leads → structural downward pressure (overvaluation correction)

Thus endogenous drift determines the **direction** of the structural asymmetry.

---

# **5.6.2 Exogenous Drift (Noise-Induced $\alpha$-Drift)**

The term
$$\xi(t)=\xi_0(t)+\chi\,\phi(t)$$
captures the joint effect of **measurement error** and **crowd psychology**.
This exogenous component **modulates or temporarily reverses** the structural $\alpha$-drift.

* **$\xi(t)>0$**: external stimuli induce buying pressure, **temporarily overstating $\alpha$**
* **$\xi(t)<0$**: fear-driven reactions induce selling pressure, **compressing or reversing $\alpha$**

If $\xi(t)$ remains persistently positive, the market forms a **bubble-like displacement**.
If persistently negative, it enters **stagnation or recessionary regimes**.

> **Remark.**
> Exogenous noise disturbs the **phase velocity** (rate of change) of $\alpha$,
> whereas endogenous drift determines its **baseline direction** (mean slope).
> Consequently, the observed market-level $\alpha$ is an **interference wave** between these two components.

---

# **5.6.3 Interpretation of the $\alpha$-Drift**

The market generates a structural displacement via **technological recursion (endogenous)**
and modulates/amplifies this displacement through **crowd psychology and information flow (exogenous)**.

Formally,

$$
\text{Market}
= \text{Structural Delay System (Endogenous)}

* \text{Stochastic Interference System (Exogenous)}.
  $$

Hence, RIMC does not describe a conventional “forecasting model,”
but a **recursive dynamical system in which technological evolution and market sentiment co-resonate**.

---

# **5.7 Inevitability from the Observation Structure**

Even if RIMC’s governing equations are only approximate,
as long as the **collective observer** (market participants) exists,
and as long as observation has **finite precision**,
the recursion gap $\varepsilon_R$ **must** arise.

Thus, $\alpha$-drift is not a by-product of model error;
it is a **structural consequence of the observation process itself**.

As long as observation occurs, the market necessarily exhibits **phase misalignment**,
and integration of this misalignment over time produces the $\alpha$-drift.

---

# **5.8 $\alpha$ as the Central Observable in RIMC**

The mathematical structure of RIMC—the coupled system of $R$, $V$, and $\varepsilon_R$—
exists fundamentally to generate the $\alpha$-drift.

* $R(t)$ and $V(t)$: recursive production sources
* $\varepsilon_R(t)$: observation gap (asynchrony)
* $\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)$: output (market displacement)

Therefore, $\alpha$-drift becomes the **dynamic output functional** of the market,
a quantitative indicator of **directional bias** and **correction speed**.

---

# **5.9 Connection to the $\alpha$-Cycle**

When $\alpha_{\text{drift}}$ exceeds a certain threshold,
the market reacts in counter-phase, and $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$ returns to neutrality.
This process constitutes the **$\alpha$-cycle**,
whose **mean displacement corresponds to the $\alpha$-drift**:

$$
\langle \alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)\rangle_T
= \alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
$$

The $\alpha$-drift is not a transient fluctuation but a
**persistent structural displacement** along the time axis.
It forms the *substrate* of the market’s cyclical self-correction dynamics.

This periodicity is not merely an economic phenomenon but a
**recursive reflective structure**,
a manifestation of “knowledge observing and correcting itself.”

Thus, $\alpha$-drift may be interpreted as a
**physical quantity of recursive intelligence** within the market.

---

# **5.10 Implications for Finance and Investment**

The exponential-decay form of $\alpha$ in RIMC provides a framework for interpreting markets
through the **relativity of time scales**.

Market movements emerge from the disparity between:

* the **speed of learning** ($\lambda$), and
* the **speed of technological value creation** (effective $\beta\gamma$).

| Market Regime    | $\lambda$ (Learning Speed) | Theoretical Implication | Behavioral Tendency (Conceptual)                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sluggish market  | Low (slow incorporation)   | Information accumulates | **Structural long bias** during persistent $\varepsilon_R>0$             |
| Sensitive market | High (fast incorporation)  | Rapid event-reaction    | **Short-horizon rotation / trend-following** aligned with release phases |

In RIMC, $\alpha$ represents the **informational wave** produced by:

* the market’s speed of learning from the **past** ($\lambda$), and
* technology’s speed of generating the **future** ($\beta\gamma$).

Hence, RIMC’s $\alpha$ differs from the CAPM-style residual alpha:
it is **structural return** generated by **information delay and sensitivity variability**,
not by cross-sectional risk premia.

This return cannot be fully explained by traditional risk factors,
because it arises from the **temporal structure of observation**,
not from static risk–return trade-offs.

---

# **5.11 Non-Uniqueness and Observation Coordinates in RIMC**

The observation coordinate implied by RIMC resembles not wavefunction collapse,
but an **open system undergoing decoherence** through interaction with its environment.

As established earlier (Section 3.6.3),
the market consists of **multiple asynchronous observers**
with heterogeneous time constants and reaction speeds.

Here we formalize these as **observer-specific coordinate systems** $\mathcal{R}_i$,
whose interference produces the **structural mechanism** that generates $\alpha$-drift.

RIMC thus possesses a **non-unique structure**:
it is not a single universal equation but an ensemble of observer-dependent dynamics.

Each agent (firm, investor, sovereign) possesses its own
learning rate $\lambda_i$, memory window $T_i$, and sensitivity kernel $G_i(t)$.

This heterogeneity is precisely what generates the
**observational recursion structure** responsible for $\alpha$-drift.

Thus, RIMC is not a single “market equation,”
but a **dynamic coordinate system** reconstructed per observer.

> **Interpretation.**
> RIMC should be understood as not one equilibrium model but
> a collection of dynamic coordinate systems $\mathcal{R}_i$ defined by
> individual time constants $\lambda_i$, sensitivity kernels $G_i(t)$, and delays $\tau_i$.
> The interference of these asynchronous coordinates produces the
> observed phenomena of price variation, volatility, and $\alpha$-drift.

Formally, this ensemble is:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{RIMC}}
= \bigcup_i \mathcal{R}_i
$$

Each $\mathcal{R}_i$ is a local observation space, and the actual market is the
**interferometric superposition** of these heterogeneous observers.

This formalization generalizes RIMC into a **stochastic field–like information dynamical system**.

---

# **5.12 Summary: The Market as a Temporal Structure of $\alpha$**

Markets continuously pursue information,
but their reactions are governed by a **time constant** $\lambda^{-1}$.
Technological value generation accelerates via **superlinear functions** ($r^\beta$),
while market learning follows a **decay kernel** ($e^{-\lambda t}$).

Their interaction produces both $\alpha$-cycles and $\alpha$-drifts.

> **The market is a recursive temporal system oscillating between**
> **the speed at which it learns the past ($\lambda$)**
> **and the speed at which technology generates the future ($\beta\gamma$).**

A larger $|\beta\gamma - \lambda|$ implies stronger non-stationarity
and higher-amplitude $\alpha$ oscillations.

As information density increases, the $\alpha$-cycle period $T_\alpha$ shortens.
The market behaves not as a static equilibrium but a
**dynamic recursive equilibrium**,
continuously self-correcting through capital–information circulation.

The fundamental unit is the recursively evolving **firm**,
and their aggregation forms the **global $\alpha$-spectrum** of the economy.

---

# **5.12.1 Historical Connections**

RIMC’s $\alpha$-cycle formally resembles Kondratiev waves and Schumpeterian **creative destruction**,
and aligns conceptually with Aghion–Howitt’s (1992) **Endogenous Growth Theory**.

These frameworks treat knowledge accumulation and innovation as internal economic drivers.
RIMC extends them by explicitly modelling
the **observation delay** and **sensitivity kernels** between technological evolution and market reaction.

---

# **5.13 Sketch of Stability**

Let $r^\ast \equiv h(R^\ast)$ and evaluate coefficients at fixed time.

For $\tau=0$, the steady state $(V^\ast, R^\ast)$ satisfies:

$$
L A (r^\ast)^\beta = \kappa_V (V^\ast)^\mu,
\qquad
\gamma (V^\ast)^\delta = \kappa_R (R^\ast)^\nu
$$

Sufficiently strong decay and moderate sensitivity yield local stability,
while increasing $\tau$ induces **periodicization** (Hopf-like transition).

Once $\tau$ crosses a critical threshold, the equilibrium loses stability
and the system enters **self-excited oscillations (Hopf bifurcation)**.

Thus the $\alpha$-cycle can be viewed as the observational manifestation
of this nonlinear bifurcation.

> **Note.**
> Because $\tau>0$, Jacobian analysis alone is insufficient;
> eigenvalues satisfy the transcendental equation
> $$\det(\lambda I - J e^{-\lambda\tau})=0$$
> so stability characterization requires Lyapunov exponents or
> numerical phase analysis.

# **5.14 Connection to Continuous-Time Finance:

Reconstructing CAPM via the $\alpha$-Drift**

RIMC, founded on the temporal asynchrony between
technological recursion $R(t)$ and economic value $V(t)$,
derives the $\alpha$-drift equation as a structural consequence.

Although RIMC appears distinct from the traditional
**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**,
both frameworks fundamentally address **return formation under imperfect information**.

RIMC’s $\alpha$ is not the residual of a risk premium;
it is a **persistent displacement created by informational asynchrony**.

When CAPM is recast in continuous time,
its static equilibrium implicitly contains delay structures
analogous to those formalized in RIMC.

The next chapter reconstructs CAPM as a time-dependent differential system
within the RIMC framework, deriving the explicit
**mapping between CAPM equilibrium and the $\alpha$-drift equation**.
