# Recursive Intelligence Market Cycle Hypothesis (RIMC)

## Abstract

**This equation probably moves.**

**RIMC: Recursive Intelligence Market Cycle Hypothesis**
*A Framework for Temporal Asymmetry and α-Drift in Technological Economies*

The **RIMC hypothesis** models the dynamic and asynchronous interaction between technological recursiveness (**R**) and market valuation (**V**).
It posits that **α (alpha)** is not a statistical residual or excess return, but an **informational drift** generated by delayed learning and recursive feedback within complex markets.

RIMC formalizes this mechanism through a minimal set of coupled differential equations linking recursive innovation, observation delay, and valuation response.

Within this temporal structure, two emergent phenomena appear:

* **α-Cycle** — a recurrent oscillation driven by the phase gap between realized innovation and its market recognition;
* **α-Drift** — a structural bias accumulating over time as delayed information is gradually absorbed.

By introducing time-lagged observation and recursive coupling, RIMC extends classical frameworks such as CAPM into a **continuous-time, learning-based system**.
In this view, markets behave as **recursive learning systems**—entities that update imperfectly and non-synchronously with respect to underlying technological evolution.
Thus, what appears as inefficiency is not noise but a **structural manifestation of temporal learning asymmetry**.

## 1. Introduction: Origins of the Hypothesis and the Recursive Discovery Process

---

### 1.1 Observational Limits and the Discovery of Recursion

The **Recursive Intelligence Market Cycle Hypothesis (RIMC)** presented here
treats markets as **Learning Observation Systems**.

This hypothesis grew out of direct empirical observation in equity markets:
a persistent sense that the market **recognizes corporate technological evolution only with delay**.

> **Interpretation of “Intelligence” in RIMC**
> In this hypothesis, *intelligence* does not refer to the cognition or intention of individual agents.
> Rather, it denotes the aggregate process through which the market absorbs, adjusts to, and responds to information—
> a system-level, temporally extended **intelligent behavior** emerging from recursive updating.

### 1.1.1 Technological Recursion and Observation Delay

Within firms, **technological recursiveness**—AI deployment, automation, R&D compounding, knowledge reuse—accelerates continuously.
However, markets can observe only **externalized signals** $S$ such as disclosures, earnings, and public data.

Thus, market valuation $V$ is formed not from the true, contemporaneous $R$,
but from a **time-lagged approximation** $\hat{R}(t)$.

This creates a **non-simultaneous mapping**:

$$
R(t)
\xrightarrow[\text{observation delay}\tau]{}
\hat{R}(t)
\rightarrow
V(t)
$$

The misalignment produced by this mapping generates a **temporal structure** within markets.

### 1.1.2 Asynchrony as the Origin of α

The key insight is that the discrepancy
$\varepsilon_R(t) = R(t) - \hat{R}(t)$
is not merely error noise, but a **systematic deviation arising from finite learning speed**.

As this asynchronous deviation accumulates over time, it produces
a **persistent mean displacement α** — the **α-drift**.

Thus, α is not “excess return,” but a **structural residual of finite-speed observation and delayed learning**.

RIMC aims to **mathematically describe this observation-delay structure**.

---

### 1.1.3 Methodological Assumptions

* The equations are not intended as exact solutions but as **structural visualizations** of informational dynamics.
* Parameters are treated as data-dependent estimation functions rather than constants.
* Validation is delegated to specialized empirical domains; the purpose here is to show the **structural inevitability** of α.

RIMC is not a predictive model.
It is a framework for visualizing **how information movements precede price movements**.

---

### 1.1.4 Observation as Learning Speed

This hypothesis does not predict future values.
Rather, it models **the rate at which markets learn and absorb information**.

The recursive learning process—incorporation, correction, re-evaluation—constitutes
a **Recursive Learning System**.

Its periodic lag generates the **α-cycle**;
its long-run bias generates the **α-drift**.

---

## 1.2 Limits of Reflexivity Theory and the Need for Extension

The conceptual origin of RIMC lies in George Soros’s **Reflexivity**.
Reflexivity frames markets not as passive mirrors but as systems where perceptions and actions recursively co-determine prices.

However, classical reflexivity is centered on **psychological recursion**—
it does not directly account for
**technological, algorithmic, and data-driven learning structures**
that increasingly shape capital flows today.

In modern markets, **non-human learning systems** (AI models, automated decision pipelines, data ecosystems)
significantly influence valuation dynamics.
The locus of recursion is shifting from **individual cognition** to **technological information cycles**.

---

## 1.3 RIMC as Technological Recursion

RIMC inherits the structural insight of reflexivity but **relocates the core variable** to
**technological recursiveness $R$**.

Here, $R$ is not merely “R&D velocity.”
It represents the **self-improving velocity vector** arising from interactions among
knowledge, data, algorithms, organizational learning, and capital.

> **Technological Recursiveness $R$ = the velocity at which technology, knowledge, and organizational structures update and reinforce one another**

As $R$ increases, value creation becomes more nonlinear,
and **temporal asynchrony** widens.
$V$ becomes a projection of $R$’s past, producing a persistent deviation $\varepsilon_R(t)$.

RIMC expresses this dynamic through a **system of coupled differential equations**.

## 1.4 Co-creation with ChatGPT: Formation of the Foundational Equations

The core equations of RIMC emerged from iterative dialogue with an AI system (ChatGPT).
Through repeated refinement, a **minimal structure** capturing the coupling of $R$ and $V$ surfaced naturally:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dV}{dt} = L \cdot A \cdot R^{\beta} \\
\dfrac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot V^{\delta}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:

| Symbol                | Interpretation                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| $V(t)$                | Market Value                           |
| $R(t)$                | Technological Recursiveness            |
| $L$                   | Social/learning acceptance rate        |
| $A$                   | Capital allocation intensity           |
| $\beta,\gamma,\delta$ | Nonlinearities and cross-sensitivities |

This system formalizes the intuition that
**technology generates capital, and capital accelerates technology**,
forming a recursive loop.

Subsequent chapters introduce **observation delay $\tau$**,
**relaxation terms $\kappa$**,
and the explicit mechanisms through which **α emerges**.

---

## 1.5 Purpose and Scope: Reframing α

RIMC’s central aim is to **redefine α**.
In CAPM and EMH, α is treated as a random residual—unpredictable noise.

RIMC instead defines:

> **α = a structural informational drift arising from finite-speed information transmission**

As markets learn, interpret, and re-evaluate technological progress,
they generate time-integrated deviations—**α as a temporal artifact**.

Thus α becomes a **structural quantity**, not an anomaly.

RIMC does not destroy CAPM;
it **extends it into a non-instantaneous, continuous-time learning framework**,
within which α regains interpretive meaning.

## Supplement: Definitions and Hierarchy of $R$ and $V$

RIMC defines **$R(t)$** and **$V(t)$** as a **reciprocal recursive system**.

### $R(t)$ — Technological Recursiveness

The velocity at which knowledge, algorithms, processes, and organizational structures
**self-improve and reinforce one another**.

### $V(t)$ — Market Value

The observable economic projection of $R$: earnings, market cap, sector value, GDP, etc.

These variables admit multiple scales:

| Scale | $R$                         | $V$                       | Examples                  |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Micro | $R_1$: Firm-level recursion | $V_1$: Firm value         | NVIDIA, Google            |
| Meso  | $R_2$: Industry recursion   | $V_2$: Sector value       | AI sector, semiconductors |
| Macro | $R_3$: Societal recursion   | $V_3$: Economy-wide value | Global markets, GDP       |

The **temporal asynchrony** (observation delay $\tau$)
across these scales is the primary generator of **α** in RIMC.
