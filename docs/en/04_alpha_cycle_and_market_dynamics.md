## **4.1 Definition of Cyclical Dynamics in RIMC**

As established in the previous chapter, fluctuations in RIMC arise from the **asynchrony** between:

* the firm’s *actual aggregated technological recursiveness*
  $r_{\text{real}}(t) \equiv h(\mathbf{R}_{\text{real}}(t))$

and

* the market’s *observed, estimated, and priced-in recursiveness*
  $r_{\text{market}}(t) \equiv h(\hat{\mathbf{R}}(t))$

This asynchrony does not dissipate instantaneously. Instead, the market **absorbs information with delay**, correcting itself only gradually.
During this learning–adjustment process, discrepancies **accumulate and discharge** over time.

Thus, $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$ is not merely a pointwise deviation; it is a
**cyclical equilibrium structure of informational energy**, formed by the temporal accumulation of recursive error.

We begin by defining the recursion-gap:

$$
\varepsilon_R(t)= r_{\text{real}}(t)-r_{\text{market}}(t)
$$

Next, define the sensitivity kernel (the mapping from $R$-gap to value dynamics):

$$
G(t)
= \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( \frac{dV}{dt} \right)\right|{r=r_\ast(t)}
= L(t)\, A(t)\, \beta \, [r_\ast(t)]^{\beta - 1}
$$

Using this kernel, the **general form of the $\alpha$-cycle with an exponential memory kernel** is:

$$
\boxed{
\alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)
= \int_{t_0}^{t} \varepsilon_R(\tau)\, G(\tau)\, e^{-\lambda (t-\tau)}\, d\tau
}
\tag{4.1}
$$

This structure is mathematically isomorphic to linear-response theory (Green’s functions) in physics:
RC-circuit charge dynamics, radioactive-decay kernels, or neuronal leaky integrators.
Within RIMC, $\alpha$ represents a **generalized dynamical quantity describing the storage and release of informational energy**.

Here $\lambda>0$ denotes the **market’s learning/forgetting rate**.
(4.1) quantitatively captures how observation-delays generate **recursive oscillations** of $\alpha$ (later formalized as accumulation and release phases).

### **4.1.1 Incorporating a Finite Observation Window $T$**

Real markets do not integrate information over an infinite past.
RIMC therefore introduces a finite memory window $T$:

$$
\boxed{
\alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)
= \int_{t-T}^{t}\varepsilon_R(\tau)\, G(\tau)\, e^{-\lambda (t-\tau)}\, d\tau
}
$$

$T$ represents the **market’s effective memory horizon**.

With finite memory, $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$ becomes a
**dynamical waveform produced by repeated learning and forgetting**, rather than an unbounded integral of deviations.

The interaction among $T$, the learning rate $\lambda$, and the technological amplification terms (roughly $\beta\gamma$) generates the cyclical patterns discussed later.

---

## **4.1.2 Differential Form: The Generation Equation of the $\alpha$-Cycle**

Differentiating (4.1) while ignoring window-edge terms yields the first-order approximation:

$$
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{cycle}}}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)\, G(t) - \lambda\, \alpha_{\text{cycle}}(t)
\tag{4.2}
$$

(4.2) is the differential form of a Green-kernel system:
$\alpha(t)$ becomes a **first-order linear response** to the input $\varepsilon_R(t)G(t)$.

The first term is the **generation term** (tech-lead incorporation),
and the second is the **decay term** (market learning/adjustment).

Thus $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$ is not a return difference; it is
**informational energy accumulated and dissipated over time**, analogous to:

* relaxation oscillations in physics
* leaky-integrator dynamics in neuroscience

This structure yields the **alternation of accumulation and release phases** developed in the next section.

---

## **4.1.3 Delay-Induced Oscillation (Hopf-Type Intuition)**

When explicit delays $\tau>0$ appear, the characteristic equation includes $e^{-s\tau}$.
If $\tau$ exceeds a threshold, complex roots emerge, enabling quasi-periodic (Hopf-like) oscillations.

In RIMC, this is interpreted as a mechanism for generating $\alpha_{\text{cycle}}$.

However, the resulting oscillation is *not* a classic Hopf bifurcation.
It is better described as a **delay-driven quasi-periodic response without a stable fixed point**,
indicating that the market does not return to static equilibrium but maintains a persistent oscillatory state.

---

# **4.2 Two-Phase Structure: $\alpha$-Accumulation and $\alpha$-Release**

The $\alpha$-cycle in RIMC appears as a **two-phase structure** generated by the sign and magnitude of the recursion-gap $\varepsilon_R$:

| Phase                         | State of Gap                     | Market Interpretation  | Price Behavior          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Positive Accumulation (+)** | $\varepsilon_R>0$ (tech leads)   | Market under-pricing   | Drift, muted valuation  |
| **Positive Release**          | $\varepsilon_R>0$ shrinking      | Market catches up      | **Upward adjustment**   |
| **Negative Accumulation (−)** | $\varepsilon_R<0$ (market leads) | Expectation overshoot  | Prone to overextension  |
| **Negative Release**          | $\varepsilon_R<0$ shrinking      | Expectations corrected | **Downward adjustment** |

Accumulation and release follow **nonlinear threshold dynamics**.
When the gap exceeds a threshold, accumulated tension rapidly discharges, causing sharp repricing.

Because the exponential kernel $e^{-\lambda(t-\tau)}$ suppresses older deviations,
new technological developments continually regenerate $\varepsilon_R$.

Hence the $\alpha$-cycle is a **quasi-periodic interaction between information-production and market-learning**.
Its period is governed by:

* the **market learning time constant** $\lambda^{-1}$
* the **self-amplification speed of technology** (approx. $\beta\gamma$)

The repetition of this interference produces a **dynamic equilibrium** characterized by alternating generation and correction.

---

# **4.3 Asymmetry of the $\alpha$-Cycle: The Role of $\lambda$**

Empirically, the $\alpha$ waveform is **asymmetric**.
This arises because technological evolution and market learning operate at different speed regimes:

* Tech → value amplification is **superlinear** ($r^\beta,\ \beta>1$).
* Market learning is **asymptotic** ($e^{-\lambda t}$), absorbing information slowly.

Thus:

$$
T_{\text{acc}} > T_{\text{rel}}, \qquad
\left.\frac{dV}{dt}\right|_{\text{rel}}
\gg
\left.\frac{dV}{dt}\right|_{\text{acc}}
$$

Where:

* **acc**: accumulation phase
* **rel**: release phase

Interpretation of $\lambda$:

| Market Character        | $\lambda$    | Economic Interpretation                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sluggish market**     | $\downarrow$ | Long structural up-moves (AI-revolution early stage, infra-transition periods) |
| **Overreactive market** | $\uparrow$   | Short bubbles / rapid boom-bust dynamics                                       |

Here $\lambda$ is not constant but a **time-varying, endogenously shifting parameter** that reflects informational density and participant heterogeneity.
Its derivative $d\lambda/dt$ encodes whether the market is *sensitizing* or *desensitizing* over time.

Thus, the shape of the $\alpha$-cycle becomes a function of the market’s
**memory capacity and reflexive speed**.

---

# **4.4 Interference from Non-Structural Observers (Noise Amplification)**

During earnings announcements or concentrated information releases,
the market’s intrinsic recursion-gap dynamics interact with additional behaviors from
**non-structural observers**—agents reacting without understanding the underlying recursive structure.

RIMC treats this as an **exogenous noise term** $\xi(t)$:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d\alpha}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)\, G(t)
- \lambda \alpha(t)
- \xi(t)
}
\tag{4.4}
$$

Decompose $\xi(t)$ as:

$$
\xi(t)=\xi_0(t)+\chi\,\phi(t)
$$

Where:

* $\xi_0(t)$: observational noise (measurement variance, idiosyncratic delays)
* $\phi(t)$: psychological drivers (SNS posting volume, search trends, media intensity)
* $\chi$: linear sensitivity coefficient linking information-shifts to price response

Effects:

* $\xi(t)>0$: overheating, momentum-chasing → **temporary re-amplification** of $\alpha$ release
* $\xi(t)<0$: excessive cooling → downward overshoot

Thus, the noise term acts as an **exogenous perturbation** that increases
**cycle amplitude** and **phase instability**.

> **Interpretation**
> Markets consist of multiple observational layers operating at different phases.
> Non-structural observers inject noise into this multi-layered system,
> thereby disturbing the release wave of $\alpha$-drift.

## 4.5 Shortening of the $\alpha$-Cycle (Scaling Behavior)

In recent years, the widespread adoption of SNS, high-speed news dissemination, and AI-based analytics has raised **$\lambda$**,
while the increasing dimensionality of the technological stack—AI, semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, etc.—has amplified **$\beta\gamma$**.
As a result, the $\alpha$-cycle is undergoing **high-frequency scaling (shortening in time)**.

In a linearized approximation, the scaling rule can be written as:

$$
T_{\alpha} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda + \kappa_{\text{eff}}},\qquad
\kappa_{\text{eff}} \equiv \beta\,\gamma\,\Xi(R_{\ast}\,V_{\ast}\,\ldots)
$$

Here $\Xi$ is a coefficient aggregating sensitivities, level effects, and institutional frictions.
This is **not** a strict equality, but a **state-dependent scaling relation**.

Under informational over-saturation, not only the level of $\lambda$ but also its **acceleration** ($d^2\lambda/dt^2>0$) tends to rise,
such that the market is constantly generating small recursion gaps.

Consequently, the $\alpha$-cycle converges toward a **high-frequency quasi-stationary regime**,
and the market approaches a state in which **information processing and reaction are nearly synchronized**.

---

## 4.6 Multi-Layered $\alpha$ Structure: Macro-$\alpha$ and Micro-$\alpha$

Up to this point, we have treated the $\alpha$-cycle within a single market layer.
In reality, however, markets are **multi-layer systems** in which multiple recursive waves interfere.

The market does not host a single $\alpha$, but rather a
**multi-layer observation system**, in which different observer strata carry distinct delays and sensitivities.

Accordingly, $\alpha$ can be written with observer-specific delays and sensitivities as:

$$
\alpha_{\text{total}}(t)
= \sum_i \int_{t-T_i}^{t}\varepsilon_{R,i}(\tau)\, G_i(\tau)\, e^{-\lambda_i (t-\tau)}\, d\tau
$$

* **Micro-$\alpha$ (short horizon)**: model updates, GPU supply shifts, pricing changes (months–years scale)
* **Macro-$\alpha$ (long horizon)**: general-purpose technologies (GPTs) and structural shifts in society (multi-decade scale)

Interference among these components produces a
**multi-layered, superposed market oscillation** in $\alpha$.

In the Fourier domain, observing $\alpha_i(\omega)$ reveals
a **frequency-resolved energy distribution**, making differences in capital concentration and technological recursion speeds empirically visible.

## 4.7 From $\alpha$-Cycle to $\alpha$-Drift

As described above, the $\alpha$-cycle can be viewed as a
**quasi-periodic self-correcting structure** generated by repeated absorption and release of information.

In actual markets, however, this oscillation is not perfectly symmetric.
Over time, the mean level exhibits a **slow displacement**.

This displacement is what we refer to in the next chapter as **$\alpha$-Drift**,
the gradual movement of the market’s center of mass arising as the *average* offset of the cyclical motion.

If the $\alpha$-cycle encodes the **periodic structure of information flow**,
then $\alpha$-Drift describes its **mean displacement**.

This residual is not a mere error term.
It appears as a **time-averaged deviation** produced by the market’s process of absorbing and revaluing information.

In other words, the long-run drift emerges when non-synchronous “fluctuations” are integrated over time,
slightly shifting the market’s center of gravity as a **time-averaged asymmetry** of the $\alpha$ dynamics.
