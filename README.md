_A Framework for α-Drift and Learning Markets_

## 1. What is RIMC?

RIMC (Recursive Intelligence Market Cycle) is a **theoretical framework** that:

- Treats the market as a **learning system with finite-speed information processing**, not as a static equilibrium.
- Models the interaction between **technological recursion** and **economic value** as a **coupled dynamic system**.
- Reinterprets **CAPM α** as a **structural drift term** generated by **observation delay and learning dynamics**, rather than as unexplained regression residue.

RIMC is **not** a price-forecasting tool.  
It is a **language for describing “how information arrives in the market and how slowly it is absorbed”**.

## 2. Core Idea in One Paragraph

At the heart of RIMC are two coupled layers:

1. A **generative layer** where technological recursion $R(t)$ drives economic value $V(t)$ via a dynamic system (the “RV equations”).
2. An **observational layer** where the market only sees a delayed and noisy projection of that value, typically through something CAPM-like.

Because observation is **delayed, noisy, and heterogeneous across agents**, the market’s estimate of recursion $r_{\text{market}}(t)$ systematically deviates from the underlying $r_{\text{real}}(t)$.  
The time-accumulation of that deviation generates a **persistent structural bias**:

$$
\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
= \int_{t-T}^{t}\varepsilon_R(\tau)G(\tau)e^{-\lambda(t-\tau)}d\tau
$$

where:

- $\varepsilon_R(t) = r_{\text{real}}(t) - r_{\text{market}}(t)$ is the **recursion misalignment**,
- $G(t)$ is a **sensitivity kernel**,
- $\lambda$ is a **learning / forgetting rate**.

This $\alpha_{\text{drift}}$ is what RIMC calls **structural α**, emerging purely from **finite-time learning and observation delay**.

## 3. Mathematical Skeleton (Very High Level)

RIMC is built around three interacting components:

### 3.1 RV System (Technological Recursion and Value)

A generic form of the value-generation engine:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = L(t)A(t)R(t)^{\beta(t)} - \kappa_V(t)V(t)^{\mu(t)}
$$

with a complementary recursion equation for $R(t)$, e.g.:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma(t)V(t)^{\delta(t)} - \kappa_R(t)R(t)^{\nu(t)}
$$

- $R(t)$: technological recursion rate (R&D, data, organizational learning, etc.).
- $V(t)$: economic value (market cap, value proxy, etc.).
- $L,A,\gamma,\delta,\kappa_V,\kappa_R,\beta,\mu,\nu$: **time-varying, data-driven mappings** from external series $Z_t$.

RIMC assumes **“one firm, one equation”** in the sense that these mappings are **firm- or strategy-specific**, derived from the chosen information set.

### 3.2 α-Drift Dynamics

Given an observation gap between $r_{\text{real}}$ and $r_{\text{market}}$:

Define the recursion misalignment:

$$
\varepsilon_R(t) = r_{\text{real}}(t) - r_{\text{market}}(t)
$$

Define the α-drift as an exponentially weighted memory of that misalignment:

$$
\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
= \int_{t-T}^{t}\varepsilon_R(\tau)G(\tau)e^{-\lambda(t-\tau)}d\tau
$$

Differentiate to obtain the **α-drift differential equation**:

$$
\frac{d\alpha_{\text{drift}}}{dt}
= \varepsilon_R(t)G(t) - \lambda\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)
$$

This looks like a **relaxation equation**: a balance between **forward bias generation** and **learning-based decay**.

### 3.3 Connection to CAPM (Continuous-Time Generalization)

Starting from continuous-time CAPM:

$$
\frac{dr_i}{dt}
= \frac{dr_f}{dt}
\quad + \beta_i(t)\frac{d(r_m - r_f)}{dt}
\quad + \alpha_i(t)
$$

RIMC interprets the “residual” $\alpha_i(t)$ not as pure noise, but as a **projection of α-drift** generated by information delay.

The observational α extracted from past data:

$$
\alpha_{\text{obs}}(t)
= \int_{t-T}^{t}
\left[
r_i(\tau) - r_f(\tau) - \beta_i(\tau)\bigl(r_m(\tau) - r_f(\tau)\bigr)
\right] e^{-\lambda(t-\tau)}d\tau
$$

can be compared to theoretical $\alpha_{\text{drift}}(t)$

## 4. Alpha Drift Capture Ratio

To bridge **theoretical α** and **observed α**, RIMC defines the **Alpha Drift Capture Ratio**:

$$
\rho_{\alpha}(t)
= \frac{\displaystyle \int_{t-T}^{t} \bigl|\alpha_{\text{obs}}(\tau)\bigr|^2d\tau}
{\displaystyle \int_{t-T}^{t} \bigl|\varepsilon_R(\tau)G(\tau)\bigr|^2d\tau}
$$

- $0 \le \rho_{\alpha}(t) \le 1$ by construction (with appropriate regularization).
- Interpreted as a **finite-time efficiency metric**:
  - How much of the theoretically available α-drift the market has actually “captured” within a finite window.
- Recasts EMH into a **finite-time learning efficiency** problem:
  Markets are not required to be “fully efficient”, only to learn with some finite speed.

## 6. How a Quant Might Use RIMC

RIMC is designed as a **meta-layer** that can sit on top of existing models:

- **As a diagnostic:**
  - Compute $\alpha_{\text{obs}}(t)$ from your production CAPM / factor stack.
  - Propose a proxy for $\varepsilon_R(t)$ (e.g., anything you believe tracks “true innovation intensity”).
  - Estimate $\lambda$ and $G(t)$ and measure $\rho_{\alpha}(t)$ over rolling windows.
  - Interpret $\rho_{\alpha}$ as a measure of **how quickly your universe learns**.

- **As a modeling lens:**
  - Treat your existing factor model or RL-based strategy as a particular choice of **value-generation engine**.
  - Use RIMC’s observation layer to **separate “model misspecification” from “structural delay”**.
  - Examine whether persistent α is better explained by **informational lag** than by missing factors.

- **As a research scaffold:**
  - Reinterpret macro cycles, sector rotations, or tech regimes as **α-cycles** around a slowly drifting baseline.
  - Test whether transitions resemble **delay-induced bifurcations** rather than simple regime switches.

RIMC itself does not prescribe a trading strategy; it provides a **language** to discuss the **time structure of information and learning** in any strategy.

## 7. What RIMC Is Not

To avoid misunderstandings:

- It is **not** a fully specified asset-pricing model ready for direct implementation.
- It is **not** a claim that markets are systematically “wrong” or “inefficient” in a normative sense.
- It is **not** an alpha engine or a backtestable strategy library on its own.

Instead, RIMC should be read as:

- A **hypothesis** about how structural α arises from **finite-speed learning and observation delay**.
- A proposal for how to **measure** that structure using existing market data and factor models.
- A bridge between **nonlinear dynamical systems** and **practical factor-based finance**.

## 8. Status and Roadmap

Current status:

- The repository primarily contains a **conceptual and mathematical manuscript**.
- No production-grade code is included by default; any future code would be illustrative (simulation, toy examples, etc.), not plug-and-play for live trading.

Potential future work (if this evolves into an applied project):

- Numerical experiments: simulate simple RV systems and α-drift dynamics.
- Toy implementation of **α-drift extraction** from historical equity data.
- Empirical estimation of **finite-time efficiency** $\rho_{\alpha}(t)$ across sectors, factors, or regions.
- Comparison with classical EMH and factor models for different horizons.
